#Tuples

Differences between Strings and Lists:
- Strings only have alphanumeric characters and special symbols to represent text
- Lists allow all data types as its items/members
- strings are immutable whereas Lists are mutable

However since they differ in this way, we use tuples.
Characteristics of tuples:
- immutable
- allows differnt datatypes as items 
- iterable
- nestable

How tuples work:

- declared with parenthesis ()
- () --> empty tuple
- (50,) is a singleton tuple; a comma is required
- Tuples are sliceable and indexable with []

Tuple example 1

tup = ('C', 'Java','Python')
empty_tup = ()
single_tup = ('Park')

print(tup)
print(empty_tup)
print(single_tup)

a = (1,2,3)
b = (4,5,6)
concat_result = a + b
print('a+b', concat_result)

c = ('Hi!',)
repet_result = c * 3
print('c*3', repet_result)

d = a + b + c
print('d:', d)
print('\'Hi!\' in d:', 'Hi!' in d) #back ward slash means new line or trying to escape special characters (the quotation marks and  to avoid creating a new string)
print('7 in d:', 7 in d)

print('7 in d:)

output:
a+b = (1,2,3,4,5,6)
c*3 ('Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!')
d: (1,2,3,4,5,6,'Hi!')
'Hi!' in d: True
7 in d: False

Tuples are iterable, indexable, sliceable:

example = ('C', 'Java', 'Python', C#', JavaScript')
#indexing
print('Index 1:' example[1])
print('Last Value:', example[-1])
#slicing
print('Backwards:', example[::-1])
print('every other:', example[::2])
print('from 1 to the end:', example[1:])
print('from 1 to 3:', example[1:3])

- taking the length of a tuple is possible
- takin the min and max of a tuple is also possible 
#UNPACKING AND PACKING

fib = (0,1,1,2,3,5,8)

fib_0, fib_1, fib_n = fib[0], fib[1], fib[2:]
print('fib_0:', fib_0)
print('fib_1:', fib_1)
print('fib_n:', fib_n)
